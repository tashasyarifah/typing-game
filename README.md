# Hi everyone,

This is a part of me learning Web Dev For Beginners by Microsoft. All the materials that I used to create are provided by them.

## The Project

I learn how to use keyboard events for JavaScript.

## The Obstacle

Figure out how the flows work. Kind of explain what are the steps before it start, when it happens, and after it happened. It took several practices to get used to.

## The Results

It's fun to make. A lots of thing need to be considerate. Start small first. Make sure it runs smoothly. Then, gradually add other logic.

#### Note to Myself

- [x] Level up styles
